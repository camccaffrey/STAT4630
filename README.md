## Setup Instructions

For more detailed instructions, follow [this tutorial](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html).

### Prerequisites

-   Create a free [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).

-   Install/Update R and Rstudio.

-   Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Clone Repository

In Rstudio, create a new project: *File \> New Project \> Version Control \> Git*.

-   Enter <https://github.com/camccaffrey/STAT4630> for "Repository URL."

-   Notice where the project will be saved under "Create project as subdirectory of."

-   It will be easiest if you leave "Project directory name" unchanged.

### Loading Packages

The [renv](https://posit.co/blog/renv-project-environments-for-r/) package is a dependency manager that makes R projects more isoloated, portable, and reproducible. Once you've cloned the repository, simply run `renv::restore()` to install all necessary packages (you may need to run `renv::activate()` beforehand). To update the list of dependencies, just run `renv:snapshot()`; this will capture all libraries used inside the project. If, for whatever reason, you need to exit this environment, navigate to *Project (STAT 4630)* > *Close Project*.

If you run into issues with `renv`, try using `load_requirements()` from `Scripts/config.R` instead.

### Creating Local Changes

*Note: to use version control, you must be inside of an R project. You can open the project by locating the `STAT4630.Rproj` file.*

#### Pulling

Prior to making any local changes, navigate to *Version Control (GIT)* \> *Pull Branches*. "Pulling" will ensure that your local version is up-to-date with the repository on GitHub.

#### Saving

To make changes, edit your files as you normally would, remembering to save frequently. However, know that "saving" *will only update the code in your local files on your computer's file system*.

#### Committing

To actually make updates to the version control system, you must "commit" your changes. When you commit code, you are creating a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time, along with a commit message that describes what changes were made. Commits provide a history of changes, making it possible to revert to previous states of your code, track who made what changes, and collaborate with others seamlessly.

To make a commit, navigate to *Version Control (GIT)* \> *Commit*.

1.  In the top left "Staged" box, select the changed files you would like to include in your commit.
    -   At the bottom, you will see changes for the selected file. Additions will appear green and deletions will appear red.
2.  Type a message in "Commit message", such as "Updated README" or "Added data cleaning script."
3.  Click "Commit."

### Pushing to GitHub

"Pushing" allows you to share your committed changes to a remote location; in this case, our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/camccaffrey/STAT4630). When you're ready, navigate to *Version Control (GIT)* \> *Push Branch*.
